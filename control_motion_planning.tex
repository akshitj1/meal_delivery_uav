\section{Control and Motion Planning}

\subsection{Control}
Control of our vehicle can be thought as two seperate controllers, One for VTOL phase when forces and moments are primarily generated by diffrential thrust. During VTOL phase lifting surfaces have negligible control effects and can be ignored. While during forward flight, we shut down vertical facing propellers and all all forces, moments are generated by lifting surfaces(wings, elevons).

In this section, we study control of quadrotors and slightly more complex but interesting case of VTOL fixed wing tailsitters.

\subsubsection{Quadrotors}
Quadrotors are specific case of more general multi-rotor UAVs. Quadrotors have become primarily popular, as it has contains no complex or high stress moving parts unlike swash plates in helicopters. Additionaly conventional wisdom says, atleast 4 coplanar actuators are needed for good controllability. Since, our UAV has 4 top facing propellers, study of control of quadrotors is relevant. We primarily refer to \cite{mellinger2011minimum} and \cite{lee2010geometric}.
