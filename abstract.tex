% The abstract must be a concise yet comprehensive reflection of what is in your article. In particular:
% • The abstract must be self-contained, without abbreviations, footnotes, or references. It should be a microcosm of the full article.
% • The abstract must be between 200–250 words. Be sure that you adhere to these limits; otherwise, you will need to edit your abstract accordingly.
% • The abstract must be written as one paragraph, and should not contain displayed mathematical equations or tabular material.
% • The abstract should include three or four different keywords or phrases, as this will help readers to fi nd it. It is important to avoid over-repetition of such phrases as

\begin{abstract}
    Meal delivery is growing 300\% faster than dine-in traffic. Current meal delivery models involves a person delivering a 
    meal on a bike or car. The weight overhead (vehicle + person) and lack of autonomy leads to energy ineffeciency and high delivery cost. 
    Additionally, use of ground vehicle contributes to congestion on roads.
    We propose hybrid Vertical take off and landing(VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) for completely autonomous operations. 
    We propose rooftop landing for safety, hybrid fixed wing platform for effecient forward flight, frequent charge model to reduce battery weight and visual navigation, mapping and obstacle avoidance to reduce sensor weight
    and reliability. Design of UAV and cost analysis is presented for proposed model. We also survey current state of aerial platforms, 
    battery technologies, sensors, perception algorithms prevalent to general aerial use cases.
